# Financial-Sentiment-Distillation
This project leverages knowledge distillation to create a lightweight yet powerful sentiment analysis model, tailored specifically for financial news data. Using a teacher-student approach, the project distills knowledge from a large FinBERT model into a compact DistilBERT-based student model, balancing performance and efficiency.
